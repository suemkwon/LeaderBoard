# LeaderBoard

Project Overview.
In this project, you will implement a leaderboard for an imaginary programming
competition. For now, the programming competition and leaderboard are simple. Each
contestant, who is identified by a name may submit a single solution, which will then be
given a numerical score (this is an integer). The leaderboard is meant to maintain a list
of the top M scores (along with the Contestantâ€™s name) that have currently been
awarded. No other information needs to be stored at this point.
